## Manage your Mac like a boss

I love Mathias Bynen's [OSX defaults script[(https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).  I and others have asked that it be split out into a separte repository

see [here](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/issues/477).

The basic idea is to create a separate repository to manage OSX defaults and make it slightly more configurable/less opinionated so that people who don't use these dotfiles can still benefit from the work the community is doing on the programmatic configuration of OSX.
