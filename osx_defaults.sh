# NOTE: How to track changes to create your own commands:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# $ defaults read > a
# ---- Change a setting, then: ----
# $ defaults read > b
# $ diff a b
#
# Doing this creates files called a and b, then displays the difference between
# them. With this knowledge you can then open up the file b in Sublime Text 2,
# search for the bit that changed and try and work out the command to change it.
